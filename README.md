Project: Testing Practice
=============

A bunch of functions built following TDD principles.

About
-----

This project was completed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) [Javascript](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript) curriculum. It is the eleventh project required for completion of the JavaScript Course [11/12].

These were the project requirements:

Build tests for the following functions, and then make the tests pass:

- [x] A `capitalize(string)` function that takes a string and returns it with the first character capitalized.
- [x] A `reverseString(string)` function that takes a string and returns it reversed.
- [x] A calculator object that contains functions for the basic operations: `add()`, `subtract()`, `divide()`, and `multiply()`.
- [x] A `caesarCipher(string, shiftValue)` function that takes a string and a shift factor and returns it with each character “shifted”
- [x] An `analyzeArray(array)` function that takes an array of numbers and returns an object with the following properties: average, min, max, and length.

What I Learned
-----

TDD wasn't a new concept for me since I started my coding journey with the Ruby curriculum. However, I did learn how to set up Jest for my projects, and honestly, Jest felt MUCh easier than Rspec.
